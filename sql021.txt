Normalization:

        dividing one bigger table to smaller table making relationship is 
        known as Normalization .
        it is used to reduce
                1> insertion anomaly
                2> updation anomaly
                3> delition anomaly
        it minimize the redundecy
1> insertion anomaly
        while inserting table data in table unnecessarly multiple type is known as
        insertion anomaly.

2> updation anomaly:
        if we try to update one particular data from one table then it will update all dats'S
        which same records in that table it is known as updation anomaly.

3> delition anomaly:
        same name multiple records are available in a table and we try to delete
        one particular data then it will delete all records this kind of problem 
        is known as delition anomaly .

        to solve this three types of anomaly we are using Normalization

Normalization
        1NF ( FIRst Normalization )
        2NF ( second Normalization )
        3NF ( FIRst Normalization )

FIRst Normalization rules
        1> in single attribute (column ) should be present
        2> same name multiple attribute can't present 
        3> order does't matter
second Normalization rules
        1> FIRst Normalization rules should follow
        2> no  partial dependecy

        NOte :
         partial dependecy :
                all coloumn should be depend are primary key
                that is known as partial dependecy ..
         No partial dependecy:
                if any coloumn not depending on primary key is known as no partial 
                dependecy

third Normalization :

        1> 2NF should be falow
        2> no trasique dependecy 
        3> non primary and not primary two coloumns can't depend each other
